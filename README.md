# Fashion-Blog
A pretend Fashion Blog built by looking at example webpage output (https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/fashion.html?_gl=1*un5h2m*_ga*NDI0NTA2MjE1NS4xNjY4NTQ0NjQ5*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY2OTE0OTYwNC4xMC4xLjE2NjkxNTAzNjEuNTcuMC4w). 

To be clear, I wrote html to match the given output then I went through given steps to check. Turns out I worked more or less top to bottom while they started with headers before adding smaller content. I like their approach but mine was easier given I was matching output kind of section by section instead of doing similar work together. 

My pretend links are extras. View source to see the different between mine and sample code. I used Semantic HTML learned recently. I learned Semantic HTML has clearer structure and helps web crawlers. I'm sure Isa will love her Fashion Blog! Credit to Codecademy for project idea and sample. 

Method: One step at a time, or iterative development style. MDN Web Docs for quick reference -- to make sure I used newly learned elements correctly. Checking output after completing sections.
